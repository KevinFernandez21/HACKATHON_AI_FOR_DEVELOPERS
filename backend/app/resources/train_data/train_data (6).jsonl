His studies have estab-lished that our eating choices are indeed mostly routines that are weakly based on hunger and more strongly based on context, such as the size of plate or portion, or how visible the treat is. For a study that won him the Ig Nobel Prize, he infamously devised a bottomless soup bowl that surreptitiously refilled itself as people ate from it.25 Though they reported not feeling any fuller than those who had a single bowl of soup, those who ate from the ever-full bowl consumed almost twice as much\u201476 percent more.

Since misery loves company, it is a lot of fun. We try to find the worst past employment experience in our group and then deconstruct the job to determine why it was so terrible. The room echoes with groans of sympathy as the students talk about summers spent shoveling pig manure or their scorching, exhausting, and mosquito-plagued months spent tree planting. But invariably, the jobs voted \u201cworst\u201d aren\u2019t the physically demanding ones; the worst are the mind-numbingly boring ones. For example, one bright young man used to spend his potential straightening cardboard boxes when they occasionally became misaligned crossing conveyor belts.

We go to the same restaurants, order the same food, watch the same shows, without really considering possibly better options.63 On the other hand, routines are easy to maintain and can be undertaken even when we\u2019re exhausted.64 By intentionally adopting a routine, we can pursue long-term goals even when our wills are weary and temptations abound. We push forward oblivious to other choices, choices that might mean stopping, resting, doing otherwise. The fewer moments of choice there are, the less likely you will be to procrastinate.65 That is, if you have the right kind of habits. Routines are like Don Quixote\u2019s windmills; they can raise you up to the heavens or drop you down into the mud. Though we have our share of bad habits\u2014reflexively turning on the TV or finishing a bag of potato chips\u2014we can create good ones. We can turn exercising, cleaning, or working into at least semi-automatic routines. Scientific study confirms the benefit of this effort; procrastinators perform as well as anyone else when the work is routine.66"}]}
