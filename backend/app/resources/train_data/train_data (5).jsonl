Her parents owned a small grocery store, where she worked every afternoon during high school. Lilly won a scholarship to col- lege, majored in economics, and planned to go to business school. In her junior year, her mother fell ill, and Lilly offered to move back home. Her mother encouraged her to stay in school, but her father expected Lilly to return home to care for her mother and help out in the market. Lilly agonized over what she should do. She wanted to fulfill her mother\u2019s dream of being well educated and successful, but she also wanted the approval of her father. Unable to make a decision, Lilly became distracted in school and put off doing her work.

We are talking about the performance of the CEO of your brain.1 Just as the CEO of a busi- ness is responsible for the performance of the overall company, the ex- ecutive part of your brain coordinates, regulates, and integrates the different structures and systems of your brain to give you a smooth, ongoing sense of yourself with your personality, goals, values, and skills. Your inner executive takes in information from your senses, your history, your thoughts, and uses this information in a goal- directed way to enable you to accomplish what is important to you."}]}

In our consumer-driven, ac- quisition-oriented society, one word that characterizes modern life is \u201cmore.\u201d We have more information, more speed, more choices, more cars, more stuff, more TV channels, more mobility, more de- mands on our time. More, more, more. Yet, with this seemingly insa- tiable press for more, many of us end up feeling like we actually have less of what matters most: less downtime, less privacy, less opportu- nity to pursue our passions, less time with the people we love, less time for our creative pursuits. It is easy to get caught up in the push for more. Procrastination may be a reflection of our feeling over- whelmed by too much, or it may express a yearning for something we are missing. Instead of relying on procrastination, we think it is important to say yes consciously to what enhances life, to say no to what detracts from it, and to say it directly rather than using pro- crastination to say it for you."}]}
