As  Bill,  a  football  player, said  about  his  daily  exercise  routine,  \u201cI  hate  sit-ups.  If  I  leave  them  for  last  I dread  my  entire  workout.  It  ruins  my  attitude  about  the  whole  workout. However, when I decided to do my sit-ups first, they went faster and I actually enjoyed the rest of my workout. That small shift made a big difference in how I feel about exercise.\u201d"}]}
