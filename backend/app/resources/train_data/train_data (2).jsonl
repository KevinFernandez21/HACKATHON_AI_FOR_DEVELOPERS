Something I noticed in these interviews is that the very best students often studied less than the group of students right below them on the GPA rankings. One of the explanations for this phenomenon turned out to be the formula detailed earlier: The best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity and therefore went out of their way to maximize their concentration\u2014radically reducing the time required to prepare for tests or write papers, without diminishing the quality of their results."}]}

Once we\u2019ve stipulated this reality, we must then step back to remind ourselves that it doesn\u2019t undermine the general value of depth. Why? Because the necessity of distraction in these executives\u2019 work lives is highly specific to their particular jobs. A good chief executive is essentially a hard-to-automate decision engine, not unlike IBM\u2019s Jeopardy!-playing Watson system. They have built up a hard-won repository of experience and have honed and proved an instinct for their market. They\u2019re then presented inputs throughout the day\u2014in the form of e-mails, meetings, site visits, and the like\u2014that they must process and act on. To ask a CEO to spend four hours thinking deeply about a single problem is a waste of what makes him or her valuable. It\u2019s better to hire three smart subordinates to think deeply about the problem and then bring their solutions to the executive for a final decision."}]}
